                <div class="overview">
                    <p>At the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA), unused and duplicate files were piling
                        up—wasting time and inflating the school’s data-center footprint. We applied behavioral design
                        to normalize digital tidying through a visual awareness campaign (bold stickers/posters with QR
                        codes to the tool) and an interactive prototype that made deleting feel Efficient and
                        effortless. </p>
                    <p>The prototype showcased clear file categories (Date, Size, Last Edited), gameification
                        mechanics to promote regular file maintenance, and risk-reducing guidance. Nudging (repeated
                        visual cues) and social proof (peer visibility) kept file maintenance top-of-mind. </p>

                    <p>The development of the final product was preceded by an extended research phase. Based on the
                        assignment provided by the Knowledge Mile, we investigated the issues caused by large-scale
                        cloud storage usage—both ecological and financial. From this research, we identified our key
                        stakeholders and target user demographic.</p>
                    <p>Maintaining a user-centered approach throughout, we conducted extensive user interviews, followed
                        by multiple rounds of user testing and guerilla tests. Through this process, my team and I
                        developed a concept aimed at alleviating—and ultimately mitigating—the excessive use of
                        organizational cloud storage through the regular use of our cleanup app.</p>
                    <p>After developing our first prototype, I conducted user tests with our focus group. Using their
                        feedback, I iterated the design and created a final prototype in Figma, which we successfully
                        presented to our client.</p>

                    <p>I grounded the strategy in BJ Fogg’s B=MAP model and complemented it with Cialdini’s principles
                        (Commitment, Social Proof) and Nir Eyal’s Hook Model. The goal was to drive repeated use of a
                        digital decluttering tool. </p>

                    <p>Survey findings (n=12) revealed a clear intention–behaviour gap: most respondents clean up only
                        once a year despite strong awareness of digital impact. Motivation was primarily practical
                        (storage and efficiency), while the main barriers were lack of time and fear of deleting
                        important files. </p>

                    <p>These insights led us to prioritise “ability” in the design: a low-friction, intuitive flow with
                        minimal steps, clear actions (e.g., drag-and-drop), and smart suggestions (e.g., flagging files
                        unused for two years) to reduce decision effort and uncertainty.</p>

                    <p>For activation, we proposed timed prompts via email/Teams/intranet and a recurring ritual such as
                        “Digital Trash Day,” supported by just-in-time reminders when many unused files are detected.
                        Given mixed attitudes toward gamification, we focused on mature feedback loops—progress and
                        measurable impact (e.g., CO₂ savings)—and avoided shame-based or overly competitive mechanics,
                        keeping any social elements positive and opt-in.</p>
