                <div class="overview">
                    <p>The application is designed to support users in making more responsible and more consistent food
                        choices by reducing decision fatigue and providing structured behavioural guidance. Through the
                        provided support the application aims to mitigate food waste resulting from loss of oversight.
                    </p>
                    <p>Building on extensive behavioural research and iterative strategy development, the concept
                        translates complex cognitive and emotional drivers of food selection into a practical,
                        easy-to-use digital tool. </p>
                    <p>Across the development process, we analysed user intentions, barriers, motivational triggers, and
                        contextual influences (as shown in the behavioural maps and clustered insights on the research
                        boards). Through this analysis, the app positions itself as a decision-support system: it
                        simplifies daily choices, nudges users toward nutritious options, and removes friction around
                        planning and preparation.
                    </p>

                    <p>I contributed across the full design process, assisting in user research, behavioural modelling,
                        and early ideation. I helped analyse user motivations and barriers, translate insights into
                        behavioural frameworks, and generate concept directions grounded in these models. I also
                        supported the creation of initial wireframes to define core interaction flows.</p>
                    <p>My primary responsibility was developing the second iteration of the prototype, where I refined
                        the structure, improved usability, and integrated the behavioural strategies established during
                        research. This iteration served as a clearer, more cohesive foundation for continued testing and
                        development.</p>

                <div id="insightsBody">
                    <p>I analysed user behaviours around planning, shopping, and cooking, and synthesised findings from
                        behavioural models and research sessions. Key insights were clear:</p>
                    <p>Users often forgot what they had at home, leading to unused ingredients and unnecessary
                        purchases. Decision fatigue caused users to choose convenience foods instead of using what was
                        already in their kitchen.</p>
                    <p>Emotional factors such as stress or low energy disrupted meal planning, increasing the likelihood
                        of waste.Users found tracking tools overwhelming unless suggestions were simple, timely, and
                        directly actionable.Personalised, context-aware reminders significantly increased the chance
                        that users would use ingredients before they expired.</p>
